        to run in the mountains or are needed to walk or start running or use them in the Gym. This
        This is what in “slang” is known as “silos”. And although running shoes may look similar
        Due to their appearance, they are actually grouped by silos according to their characteristics.

        durability, stability, etc.,…), but depending on which silo it belongs to, what type of construction is defined and for what
        type of runner and runner were designed.</p>
